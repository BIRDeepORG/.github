Organization of the project entitled "Birdsong automatic monitoring using Deep Learning for tracking ecosystems health status (BIRDeep)".

At BIRDeep project we aim at monitoring birdsong diversity in Doñana Nature Area in an automated manner developing the bioinformatics and deep-learning approaches necessary for understanding spatio-temporal changes in bird communities, in order to generate accurate predictions under future scenarios. This project is done in collaboration between Doñana Biological Station (EBD-CSIC) and U-Tad.
Funding comes from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (TED2021-129871A-I00).
